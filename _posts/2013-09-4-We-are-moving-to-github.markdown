# We moved to GitHub #
After many years on Google Code we decided to move to GitHub. The complete development for JacpFX 2 is now moved to GitHub, while the current stable version will stay on Google Code. With the migration to GitHub we introduce this GitHub pages and will will try to fill with content, especially with an updated documentation for JacpFX.
