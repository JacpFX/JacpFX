After many years on Google Code we decided to move to GitHub. The compleate development for JacpFX 2 is now moved to GitHub, while the current stable version will stay on Google Code. With the migration to GitHub we introduce this GitHub pages and will will try to fill with content, espacially with an updated documentation for JacpFX.
