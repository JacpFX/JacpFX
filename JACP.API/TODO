29. Nov. 2001 - amo - create methods to receive component ID by class name; currentyl you get in trouble when contacting a component by using full namespace like"id01.id11" but component was moved in the meanwhile. Create a kind of global registry but do not allow to access registry directly, instead allow the developer to use something like "String id=getCurrentId(ComponentA.class);"
