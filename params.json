The old project page can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/jacp/\r\n\r\nWith JavaFX 8, Java GUI development on Client side becomes (more and more) competitive again. Since the release of JavaFX 2 many frameworks were created to speed up client development with two major goals: \"**structuring the application**\" and \"**avoid blocking UI**\". \r\nMost of this projects are using a server centric approach to create enterprise grade applications. JacpFX on the other hand is a **Rich Client framework** with similar goals but, but completely client centric.  With JacpFX you structure your application with components, perspectives and a workbench **loosely coupled** through component id's. JacpFX components and perspectives are simple controller classes which makes it easy to compose you applications out of fxml files and programmatic UI parts. All parts are connected through a message bus and have a defined LiveCycle to **separate the task execution and UI changes**.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
