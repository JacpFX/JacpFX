#Features of JacpFX#
JacpFX is an UI application framework based on JavaFX, supporting developers to structure an application with loosely coupled, reusable components. It frees you from the pitfalls of traditional multi-threaded programming helping you to separate the task execution from UI changes in your client application.

###JacpFX focusing on following goals to deliver best developer and user experience:###

1. simplify the structuring of loosely coupled UI components
2. easy communication between components through a message-bus
3. supports asynchronous processes to avoid UI blocking
4. lightweight (size and memory footprint)
